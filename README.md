# ⚽ Breakout 🏀
✨ The aim of this project is to study **data persistence** between **scenes** as well as **sessions**.  

🌱 In this project:
- Scores and player names are saved to a file to be loaded every new session,
- Last entry's player name is written in advance on the name input field,
- High scores are sorted and displayed on a table in the Highscores Menu.
